### VIME

### [VIME: Variational Information Maximizing Exploration{1605}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09674)

#### Main contribution and core idea

1. agent's goal of choosing an action: max the information gain. (max the reduction in uncertainty)
2. variational inference to approximate mutual information along trajs.
3. implementation: BNNs, parameters represetation trick.

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: model good to explain the goal is to max the reduction in uncertainty.

difficult: theoretical math with practical implementation

#### Experiments and baselines

Just so so. No strong baselines.

#### How to apply and anywhere

max the information gain(mutual information).

### Self-Supervised Exploration via Disagreement
### [Self-Supervised Exploration via Disagreement{1906}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04161)

#### Main contribution and core idea

self-supervised to learn skills without external reward, learning completely from scratch.

idea: minimize prediction error and maximize the prediction difference at the same time.

![image-20211231111628770](README.assets/disagreement.png)

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

good writing, easy to read, simple yet efficient algo. 

#### Experiments and baselines

atari, minist, maze, mujuco and real robot: good performance.

baselines: pathak 2017,large scale study of curiosity-driven{all prediction error based} 

#### How to apply and anywhere

no/sparse reward envs.

**check the multi-step method**.

### Bootstrapped DQN
### [Deep Exploration via Bootstrapped DQN{1602}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04621)

#### Main contribution and core idea

contribution: a simple yet efficient DQN algorithm with good ability to explore.

core idea: multi-head q. inspired by TS(random choose head).

![image-20220102234524984](README.assets/bootstrapped_dqn.png)

**Not tried to tract exact posterior and RANDOM initialization in drl.**

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprsing: use simple task to show the **distribution** of what learned, which is similar to the true posterior.

Their team  do exploration for a long time.(very persuasive and respect).

#### Experiments and baselines

atrai; DQN. exps are ok.

#### How to apply and anywhere

multi-head -> assemble model and disagreement.

how: **multi-step, pure-exploration.**

### Unifying Count-Based Exploration
### [Unifying Count-Based Exploration and Intrinsic Motivation{1606}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01868)

#### Main contribution and core idea

contribution: unify pseudo-count in deep rl which is how to get hat{N(s)}, hat{n}. use model to build probability of counts.

core idea: use density model to produce density estimation and re-catch N(s), n. use pseudo-count to build a bonus.(normally N^{1/2} or N^{-1}). 

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: make drl countable by transfering algo in traditional/small MDP.(count by table).

diff: math derive in PG.(But it's ok now).

#### Experiments and baselines

atari, DQN, UCB.  good performance. using DQN with bonus can work well in montezuma's revenge(15 rooms in 50m steps).

#### How to apply and anywhere

how: with other algo(or modify detail of count-based).

anywhere: pseudo-count algos always use this def. like pixelcnn, #count, ex2.

**mark here(22/1/4): pseudo-count algos are not that good when compared to other algos nowadays.**

### Hash Exploration
### [#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning{1611}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04717)

#### Main contribution and core idea

contribution: A count-based algo which can be used in multi-domain.

core idea: use sim-hash to build state count.

![image-20220105102104621](README.assets/hash.png)

![image-20220105102209442](README.assets/hash_loss.png)

first part: maximize  the likelihood of output. second part: push b(s) into 0 or 1 to count better.  

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: use noise inject in sigmoid function(But didn't that popular in other place?).

#### Experiments and baselines

continuous: RLlab, VIME. 

ALE: (performance just so so), **using BASS future is well.**

conclusion: in continuous setting, it beats VIME. very good.

#### How to apply and anywhere

how: low dimension approximation(like vae).

contribution: 

1. based entirely on discriminative trained exemplar models. 

2. compare new state to past state.

3. no explicit density model.

core idea:

![image-20220106205126009](README.assets/ex2.png)

![image-20220106205324621](README.assets/ex2_obj.png)

![image-20220106205606212](README.assets/ex2_algo.png)

where D is a NN.

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: good math story and exps.

difficult: math derivative in eq(1) with implicit density estimation. 

#### Experiments and baselines

baselines: VIME, #exploration, TRPO

exps are good. beat VIME, similar with #.

#### How to apply and anywhere

the idea of new state/past states distinguish is good. but none otherwhere.

![image-20220108220323964](README.assets/pixelcnn_bonus.png)

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: MMC is rather good.(monte-carlo in exloration as noise)

difficult: no source code.

confusing: how to deal with 4 channel  in atrai with pixelcnn(maybe on channel).

#### Experiments and baselines

atrai, dqn mc/no mc, dqn cts, reactor with retrace.

exps are good, but re-cons in minigrid is painful.

#### How to apply and anywhere

how: mmc or mc(long horizon) in exploration is good.

[BACK TO LIST](#exploration)

### RND

### [Exploration by Random Network Distillation{1810}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894)

#### Main contribution and core idea

contribution: a new way to explore by **prediction error**. montezuma's revenge beats human.

core idea: use a **random & fixed** network as target.

![image-20220109153533911](README.assets/rnd.png)

intuition: for a network f, the prediction error is higher when the input x is more different with the data it has seen before. 

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: conclude 4  reasons for high prediction error.

1. training data not enough.
2. stochastic objective function
3. wrong model
4. problem with optimization.

we encourage 1 and discourage 2,3,4.

training setting detail: 

1. non episodic in intrinsic training(constant information for exploration).
2. episodic for extrinsic training(as a ddl in case of agent stuck in the start).

confusing: actual frame is more than figure(maybe figure cut).

#### Experiments and baselines

PPO, RND, Dynamics(Hagan 2018).

ablation: 1. cnn, rnn 2. num of envs 3. episodic/non-episodic

conclusion: 

1. in no extrinsic reward setting, non-episode perform better.
2. in extrinsic rewarad setting, **reward comes from two head(extrinsic and intrinsic)**.

#### How to apply and anywhere

how: policy with random network to get a boarder distribution.

anywhere: lilichen's new paper and ngu.

2. design a random, untrained **prior** network.

core idea: 

prior + noise  -> ensemble diverse -> posterior(random) like TS.

![image-20220110131547385](README.assets/rpf.png)

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

easy to read.

#### Experiments and baselines

baselines: epsilon-greedy, bootstrapped(bs), BSR(bs + L2), BSP(bs + prior)

exps:

1. scale up
2. carpole, swing-up

3. MR: BSP 2000+(good for dqn based)

#### How to apply and anywhere

how: prior regularize. (maybe) for any objetcive function in rl, we can add a **random, fixed and untrained network to encourage exploration**.

anywhere:  RND

core idea:

![image-20220111202349423](README.assets/large_curiosity.png)

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing parts

surprising: 

1. pre-trained VAE: biased to where the agent started.
2. normalization: advantage, obs, reward
3. **inf horizon**

#### Experiments and baselines

may aspects:

1. embedding: origin random good. generation: learned good.
2. parallel env 128, very useful.
3. noisy-tv is the limit of curiosity based.

#### Main contribution and core idea

contribution: 

1. handle dynamic-irrelevant information target robust policy(handle noisy env).
2. build intrinsic reward for self-supervised exploration.

core idea:

1. use **Information bottleneck(and contrastive learning)** to get a good reprresentation and use variational method to optimize.
2. build a bonys with Kl-divergence(encoder | Gaussian) as self-supervised exploration.

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: use variational method to optimize the upper/lower bound of the objective(holds for non negativity of KL-divergence).

difficult: 

1. introduce InfoNCE loss's proof.
2. relationship/similarity of count-based/curiosity-based exploration in linear/small tabular case.
