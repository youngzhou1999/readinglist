## Exploration

### [VIME: Variational Information Maximizing Exploration{1605}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09674)

#### Main contribution and core idea

1. agent's goal of choosing an action: max the information gain. (max the reduction in uncertainty)
2. variational inference to approximate mutual information along trajs.
3. implementation: BNNs, parameters represetation trick.

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: model good to explain the goal is to max the reduction in uncertainty.

difficult: theoretical math with practical implementation

### Experiments and baselines

Just so so. No strong baselines.

#### How to apply and anywhere

max the information gain(mutual information).

### [Self-Supervised Exploration via Disagreement{1906}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04161)

#### Main contribution and core idea

self-supervised to learn skills without external reward, learning completely from scratch.

idea: minimize prediction error and maximize the prediction difference at the same time.

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

good writing, easy to read, simple yet efficient algo. 

### Experiments and baselines

atari, minist, maze, mujuco and real robot: good performance.

baselines: pathak 2017,large scale study of curiosity-driven{all prediction error based} 

#### How to apply and anywhere

no/sparse reward envs.

**check the multi-step method**.

### [Deep Exploration via Bootstrapped DQN{1602}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04621)

#### Main contribution and core idea

contribution: a simple yet efficient DQN algorithm with good ability to explore.

core idea: multi-head q. inspired by TS(random choose head).

**Not tried to tract exact posterior and RANDOM initialization in drl.**

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprsing: use simple task to show the **distribution** of what learned, which is similar to the true posterior.

Their team  do exploration for a long time.(very persuasive and respect).

### Experiments and baselines

atrai; DQN. exps are ok.

#### How to apply and anywhere

multi-head -> assemble model and disagreement.

how: **multi-step, pure-exploration.**

### [Unifying Count-Based Exploration and Intrinsic Motivation{1606}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01868)

#### Main contribution and core idea

contribution: unify pseudo-count in deep rl which is how to get hat{N(s)}, hat{n}. use model to build probability of counts.

core idea: use density model to produce density estimation and re-catch N(s), n. use pseudo-count to build a bonus.(normally N^{1/2} or N^{-1}). 

#### Surprising, difficult and confusing part

surprising: make drl countable by transfering algo in traditional/small MDP.(count by table).

diff: math derive in PG.(But it's ok now).

### Experiments and baselines

atari, DQN, UCB.  good performance. using DQN with bonus can work well in montezuma's revenge(15 rooms in 50m steps).

#### How to apply and anywhere

how: with other algo(or modify detail of count-based).

anywhere: pseudo-count algos always use this def. like pixelcnn, #count, ex2.

**mark here(22/1/4): pseudo-count algos are not that good when compared to other algos nowadays.**
